# Just Intonation Music Generator

This application allows you to create music using Just Intonation principles. 
Instead of equal temperament, Just Intonation uses pure frequency ratios which 
can create more harmonic sounds.

## How to Use This Application

1. Double-click on `JustIntonationMusic.exe` to run the program
2. A command prompt window will open with several options
3. Type a number (1-5) and press Enter to select an option:
   - Option 1: Create a simple melody using Just Intonation
   - Option 2: Create a major arpeggio (A-C#-E-A-E-C#-A)
   - Option 3: Create a minor arpeggio (A-C-E-A-E-C-A)
   - Option 4: Create a Just Intonation scale
   - Option 5: Exit the program
4. When a WAV file is created, it will be saved in the same folder as the program
5. Press Enter when prompted to return to the main menu

## Playing the Generated WAV Files

After generating a WAV file, you can play it using any media player:
- Windows Media Player
- VLC
- Any other audio player that supports WAV files

Simply double-click on the WAV file or open it using your preferred media player.

## Understanding Just Intonation

Just Intonation uses frequency ratios based on the harmonic series:
- Unison (1:1) - Same note
- Minor Third (6:5) - Sounds slightly different from equal temperament
- Major Third (5:4) - Purer sound than equal temperament
- Perfect Fourth (4:3) - Very consonant interval
- Perfect Fifth (3:2) - Very pure and resonant
- Major Sixth (5:3) - Noticeably different from equal temperament
- Octave (2:1) - Same note one octave higher

The numbers (like 3:2) represent the frequency ratios. For example, 
if A = 440 Hz, then E (a perfect fifth above) would be 440 Ã— 3/2 = 660 Hz.

## Advanced Usage

If you're interested in more advanced features or creating your own compositions,
talk to your friend who created this program for you. The underlying system is
quite powerful and can be extended to create more complex music using Just Intonation
principles.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Make sure your audio is working (try playing another sound file)
2. Check that the WAV files were created in the same folder as the program
3. Try running the program as administrator if you have permission issues
4. Contact your friend who provided this program for additional help

Enjoy making music with Just Intonation!
